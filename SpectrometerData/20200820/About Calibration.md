Run a scan to measure H2 lamp spectrum. 

The stepping motor is controlled from a python notebook.

The images are manually grabbed and saved as `*.fit` files.

It turned out that 5000 steps moves the spectrum approximately by 1000 pixels.

The most of the visible H2 spectrum is covered, Balmer lines are observed from alpha to gamma (656nm - 486nm - 434nm), Fulcher-alpha is also quite pronounced.
